# InheritanceDesign
Part 1: OOP Programming - JAVA - Inheritance Design Lab

This application demonstrates the concept of inheritance. Inheritance is a method in which one object acquires/inherits another objectâ€™s properties, and inheritance also supports hierarchical classification. The idea behind this is that we can create new classes built on existing classes i.e. when you inherit from an existing class, we can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Inheritance represents the parent-child relationship.
